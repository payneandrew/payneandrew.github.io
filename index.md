# Projects

### University Innovation Fellow at _Stanford University_
UIF was created to empower students to become change agents and create innovative and creative solutions to real problems facing their communities. As a fellow, I founded a mentorship program to promote cross-class engagement between engineering students at my school, I created and hosted a professional development workshop at my school, and I attended a UIF meetup at Stanford University. Check out the article my team and I wrote about the meetup <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-we-think-differently-after-attending-fellows-valley-mccullagh/">**here.**</a>

### Electronics and Controls Engineer at Collegiate Wind Competition Capstone - _Department of Energy_
As an Engineering Student at James Madison University, my two year long capstone project is to design and fabricate a functional, small scale wind turbine to compete in the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/collegiatewindcompetition/collegiate-wind-competition">**2020 Collegiate Wind Competition**</a> in Boulder, Colorado. Utilizing 3D printers, microcontrolers, and other mechanical and electrical components we are designing a wind turbine that can maximize power at all wind speeds and perform other various tasks determined by the Department of Energy.
