# Internships 

## Software Engineering Intern at _Raytheon_
As a Software Engineering Intern at Raytheon, I worked to create a mission management system to connect and communicate with a series of autonomous vehicles in multiple domains (air, sea, land). I developed code for an autonomous goal and visualization engine that plans and executes paths for UAVâ€™s. This engine takes in inputs from the system operator about the mission plan and outputs a path that avoids threats, weather, and other vehicle traffic in the airspace.

## Software Engineering Intern at _NT Concepts_
I worked with a team of software engineers and data scienctists to develop a tracking algorithm that utilizes computer vision and image processing to track vehicles from aerial videography. Utilizing **machine learning** platform tensorflow, we input tracked data into a convolutional neural net to be trained and classified.

# Projects

## University Innovation Fellow at _Stanford University_
UIF was created to empower students to become change agents and create innovative and creative solutions to real problems facing their communities. As a fellow, I founded a mentorship program to promote cross-class engagement between engineering students at my school, I created and hosted a professional development workshop at my school, and I attended a UIF meetup at Stanford University. Check out the article my team and I wrote about the meetup <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-we-think-differently-after-attending-fellows-valley-mccullagh/">**here.**</a>

## Embedded Systems Engineer at _U.S. Department of Energy_ - Collegiate Wind Competition
As an Engineering Student at James Madison University, my two year long capstone project is to design and fabricate a functional, small scale wind turbine to compete in the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/collegiatewindcompetition/collegiate-wind-competition">**2020 Collegiate Wind Competition**</a> in Boulder, Colorado. Utilizing 3D printers, microcontrolers, and other mechanical and electrical components we are designing a wind turbine that can maximize power at all wind speeds and perform other various tasks determined by the Department of Energy.

## Undergraduate Research Assistant in Electric Vehicle Systems
As an undergraduate research assistant working under the <a href="https://eaa-1967.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?sl=1344415327">**Electric Auto Assocation**</a>, I worked to design and assemble the battery and battery management systems of an electric powered motorcycle. I also had the oppourtunity to test production class electric motorcycles at The Ohio Mile Event as pictured below.

## Project Manager at Human Powered Vehicle Project
The human powered vehicle project is a year long, client based, design project as part of the Madison Engineering department. Our client was a young girl in the community who had cerebral palsy which did not allow her to ride a traditional bicycle. From initial sketch to final physical product, my team and I built a custom human powered vehicle built specifically for her with her abilities in mind.

# Hackathons and Design Challenges

## Booz Allen Hamilton Incubator Challenge | Second Place Recipient
The Incubator Challenge is a two-week challenge to come up with a solution for a real world problem facing society. As a group my team was tasked with the problem of conveying the risk of floods by Mobile Flood Prediction Visualization. This is a serious issue because flooding is the most deadly weather-related issue in the United States (claims 200 lives a year). To solve this problem, we brainstormed many different ideas but ultimately settled on a two-tier solution that incorporated an application and drones. I took the lead for the application and created an application prototype. This app would use user input, similar to that of Waze, to connect the community together by communicating evacuation routes, requesting help, reporting safe locations, and more. First responders would also have access to this information. Our second tier of the solution was a drone that would have the ability to send live video to the app, calculate the speed and depth of the water, and use a thermal camera to find flood survivors.
This solution placed us in **2nd place** out of 8 teams.

## Bluestone Hacks
Bluestone hacks is an annual 24-hour design challenge sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture, Anavation, Willow Tree, and Red Bull. The theme was entertainment and utility and the task was to create a solution based around this theme. My team and I created an interactive app and a tactile board game that teaches people how to code. I used software and a laser cutter to create a board game that allows you to move tiles around in order to rearrange code into the correct order. I also assisted in creating the app that the board game was modeled after. In the future, I would like to refine this product by integrating an Arduino microcontroller to create a step by step check process for the game.

# Leadership Experience

## Engineering Leadership Development Program at _JMU Department of Engineering_
As a Madison Engineering Leader, I Mentored and taught eleven first-year Madison Engineering students, created a weekly lesson plans with my co-leader, received training in emotional intelligence, diversity inclusion, defining core values, and more. In addition, I also worked in the Engineering Learning Center to empower and assist first-year engineering students to succeed in their engineering classes.

## Head of Tours at _Engineering Ambassadors-JMU Chapter_
As the head of tours of the Engineering Amabassadors at James Madision University, I managed and scheduled all tours of the Engineering Department, I organized and conducted workshops for perspective students, and I attended the annual Engineering Ambassadors Network Conference at Penn State University.
